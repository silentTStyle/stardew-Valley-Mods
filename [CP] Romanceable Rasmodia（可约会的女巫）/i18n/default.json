  "event-75160022.07": "Well dear, Rasmodia will explain the ritual for you, okay?",
  "event-75160022.08": "Why, little Bianka! You've grown to become such an energetic young woman. You may not remember me, but I am a longtime friend of your mother and father.",
  "event-75160022.09": "Oh! You are!$h#$b#I'm sorry for not remembering, Ms. Rasmodia..",
  "event-75160022.10": "It is no issue, young one. I may not know the full reason of why you wish to be rid of your magic, and I may find it a waste of talent, but Esmeralda is a good friend of mine and I am here to help.",

It is easier and much more convenient to store it someplace else.#$b#That is why we have decided to have your brother, Raphael, take in your magic.",
  "event-75160022.13": "Oh!! What?$u#$b#I'm fine with that and all but... Won't the magic overflow in Raphael? Won't it be too much for him to control??$s",

  "event-75160022.15": "Yes dear, there's no need to worry for your brother. His years and years of training have increased his capacity for magic along with his control. He is very much capable of such an endeavor. Not to mention he wants to use your magic to grow into a better sorcerer and wizard one day.",
  "event-75160022.16": "Young Raphael, it is really quite impressive to have such capability for magic at your age. You may indeed reach your father and mother's level in only a short period.",
