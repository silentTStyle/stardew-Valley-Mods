"9280015.12": "All right, Gabe, we're ready! Let's hear what you found out!$h",
"9280015.13": "So, according to this book, slimes and humans once lived in peace together during the founding of Stardew Valley...",
"9280015.14": "The slimes were an isolated species until humans discovered them during the creation of the mine system.",
"9280015.15": "The slimes had created a diverse and complicated network of ecosystems in the ground that lied underneath Stardew Valley.",
"9280015.16": "The slimes were overjoyed to have new visitors. They spoke to the settlers...",
"9280015.17": "We help you!",
"9280015.18": "The slimes welcomed the humans with their special item, the Slime Heart. It was created with all the love the slimes had to offer, and it had the ability to heal almost any wound.",
"9280015.19": "For years, humans and slimes lived in harmony...#$b#But times soon became tough. The villagers needed the Slime Heart.#$b#The Slime Heart took weeks to produce when it was made by the slimes... but the humans, they figured out how to create it in minutes.#$b#They just needed the slime residue to do it.#$b#And so, with a heavy heart...",
"9280015.20": "Hello, human!",
"9280015.21": "That's awful!$s",
"9280015.22": "*Sob*$s",
"9280015.23": "Apparently slimes have been aggressive to humans ever since...$s",

"9280015.27": "It isn't that simple, Zinnia. Over time, the slimes evolved to have a language not understandable by a normal human.",

"9280015.29": "I guess so.#$b#It just feels weird not having a scientific or tactical solution. Could the problem really be fixed through friendship?",
"9280015.30": "It can, Gabe.",
"9280015.31": "@, you should get closer to Silly.#$b#Once Silly's gotten closer to you, we can plan an event where we show the town that slimes aren't really all that mean.$h",

"9280016.4": "Silly think it ready to meet the town!$h",
"9280016.5": "Hm? What did Silly say?",
"9280016.6": "Really?! That's amazing!$h",
"9280016.7": "But Silly don't wanna do unless Silly's best friends by Silly side...#$b#Zinnia, farmer...#$b#and Gabriel!",

"9280017.7": "Is someone going to tell us what's going on?",
"9280017.8": "Hi, everyone! Sorry to keep you all waiting.",
"9280017.9": "Took you long enough.",
"9280017.10": "Um, I gathered you all here today because the Adventurer's Guild has something to share with you all.",
"9280017.11": "And what is it? You're taking up lots of our time, Zinnia.",
"9280017.12": "I'm sorry, Mayor. Um, I know that it might seem pretty strange that all these new Pelican Town residents are up here making announcements, but I really appreciate everyone coming out here today.",
"9280017.13": "The truth is...#$b#We'd like you to meet someone.",
"9280017.14": "Who?",
"9280017.15": "I hope it's a new kid!",

"9280017.19": "Good work, kid! Those pesky creatures need to go!",
"9280017.20": "But, uh, what you may not have known is that, um...$s",
"9280017.21": "Um, actually, I've found some past information about these slimes that I think is really important to share.",
"9280017.22": "Gabe! You don't have to! I can handle this, I promise.$s",
"9280017.23": "It's okay, sis. I... I think I can do this.",
"9280017.24": "You see everyone...#$b#Slimes and humans once lived together in harmony!",
"9280017.25": "Really?",
"9280017.26": "How strange!",
"9280017.27": "They were able to understand humans, and humans could understand them back.#$b#They entrusted humans with their prized 'Slime Heart' item, an item made by their species through cultivating the ground with their slimy exteriors.#$b#The 'Slime Heart' was able to heal any wound and any disease.",

"9280017.29": "I'm listening...",
"9280017.30": "Humans got greedy, like they always do, though...#$b#They wanted the Slime Heart so bad that they...#$b#Invaded the slime territory and wiped out most of their population to get their hands on it.",
"9280017.31": "Horrible!",
"9280017.32": "Things have been bad with the slimes ever since.",
"9280017.33": "That's a nice story, sir, but what exactly are we supposed to do?",
"9280017.34": "Well, everyone, I think it's about time we revealed our guest...",
"9280017.35": "Who could it be?",

"Abigail.gabrielArrive": "Zinnia's nice, but she's not my friend type. I don't think I can handle that kind of sunshine-like positivity.",

"Alex.gabrielArrive": "Do you think those new people in town play ball?#$b#I've always dreamed of making a Pelican Town team.",

"Harvey.gabrielArrive": "Sorry if I seem flustered today, @.#$b#The two new arrivals in town means I have to update all my logs, and start planning annual visits...#$b#And I had just gotten done with everything for your arrival!",
"Harvey.sillyRevealed": "The Slime Heart sounds like a medical discovery waiting to happen! I can't believe it's been lost away to time all along.#$b#Say, do you have one? I'm interested in studying it's properties!$h",

"Kent.gabrielArrive": "The more people that come here, the less familiar this town feels...",
"Kent.sillyRevealed": "It's hard for me to trust a cave creature like Silly, but if I learned anything from the war...#$b#It's that you can't judge anyone before you know them.",

"Krobus.gabrielArrive": "I heard one of the new people in town hates monsters like me...",
"Krobus.sillyRevealed": "I'm so happy to see the slimes and humans in harmony. I wonder if one day my species can make amends, too...",
"Krobus.gabeFinished": "I can't believe you would lock up slimes like that. They're creatures too.#$b#I hope that your 'energy' makes people less likely to kill slimes. It's the best thing that could result from this...",

"Leah.gabrielArrive": "I'm happy that more people get to see the beauty of the countryside!",

"Marnie.gabrielArrive": "Everytime a new person joins our town, a part of me hopes that maybe Shane will be able to connect with them.#$b#I just want to see him get better.",

"Sam.gabrielArrive": "The new guys are pretty cool, you know.#$b#My mom made me go give them a welcome gift.",
"Sam.sillyRevealed": "I think Silly should come to one of me and Seb's Solarion Chronicles sessions.#$b#I can see them fitting perfectly into the story!",
"Sam.gabeFinished": "Hey, you found a way to repel those slimes?#$b#Cool! You're probably pretty smart for figuring something like that out.",

"Sebastian.gabrielArrive": "The new guy came over to say hi this morning. Didn't even bother talking to me. I doubt we'll be friends.",

//SECRET NOTES

"GESecretNotes1": "It's a page from the book Gabriel found:^^In arcane mythology, a bottle of slime energy is one of the weaker forms of energy. I have noticed that while it is hot to the touch for ordinary folk, those of a certain bloodline possess a mystical ability to control it. One of those people happens to be myself.^^Through my tracking, I've seen that the energy waves emitted from this energy seem to be attracted to a location secluded underground. I feel a certain, say, 'mutated' energy when I visit it. Don't get me started on the smell...",

"GESecretNotes2": "It's a page from the book Gabriel found:^^I've noticed some similar energies emitting from seemingly ordinary objects around the valley. Though they seem to bear no relation to the slime energy I've collected, I think it is quite interesting. Today I was walking through the fields and observed a flower in the shape of a golden star emit these frequencies. I do not know how many of these there are. I wonder what would happen if they were brought together...",

"GESecretNotes3": "It's a page from the book Gabriel found:^^I spotted a peculiar stone near the northern caves today. To my surprise it emitted the same energy frequencies that I've been looking for! I do not know the exact type of stone it was, but it reminded me of a slime frozen in space and time, perhaps turned to stone by a snake's gaze? In any case, I will continue to study the effects of this mysterious energy.",

"GESecretNotes4": "It's a page from the book Gabriel found:^^I visited an exotic market in the West Mountains yesterday. A curious fisherman's shop had something that piqued my interest: a carp that glowed with the colors of a midnight's sky. I detected the same frequencies emitting from the fish! Regrettably, I was short on bills, so I was left no choice to but to leave the specimen to the fisherman. But I will no doubt attempt to acquire it next time I visit.",

"GESecretNotes5": "It's a page from the book Gabriel found. The page is dated 80 years ago:^^I had a mind-melding dream the other night. People appeared to me - I cannot quite understand who or why, but I remember their names. I do not know if this will be needed, but I always believe in good record keeping.^^^I feel a connection to these people:^Ria^Adell^Chloe^Antoinette^@^Tina^Cammie^Guadalupe^Krysten^Ray^Hiroko^Lillianna^Jarred^Caroline^Forrest^^Who knows? I have a feeling that one of them will be my future descendant...",
